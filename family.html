<p>Hey,  </p>

<blockquote style="color: black;">
    A family is like a circle. <br>
The connection never ends,<br>
and even if at times it breaks,<br>
in time it always mends.<br><br>

A family is like the stars.<br>
Somehow they're always there.<br>
Families are those who help,<br>
who support and always care.<br><br>

A family is like a book.<br>
The ending's never clear,<br>
but through the pages of the book,<br>
their love is always near.<br><br>

A family is many things.<br>
With endless words that show<br>
who they are and what they do<br>
and how they teach you so you know.<br><br>
